# Active Context: Crazy Car

## Current Work Focus
Creating a complete HTML5 driving game from scratch. The game will be implemented in a single index.html file with embedded CSS and JavaScript.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure
- Defined game architecture and patterns
- Ready to implement the game

## Next Steps
1. Create index.html with complete game implementation
2. Implement game loop with requestAnimationFrame
3. Add player controls and lane system
4. Implement obstacle spawning and collision
5. Add scoring and high score system
6. Polish visuals and add effects

## Active Decisions
- Single file implementation for simplicity
- Lane-based movement (3 lanes) for intuitive controls
- Progressive difficulty through speed increase
- localStorage for high score persistence

## Important Patterns
- Canvas-based rendering for performance
- Game loop pattern: input → update → render
- State machine for game states
- AABB collision detection
