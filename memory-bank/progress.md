# Progress: Crazy Car

## What Works
- Memory bank initialized with project documentation
- Game architecture and patterns defined
- Complete HTML/CSS/JavaScript game implementation
- Game loop and rendering system (60fps)
- Player controls with smooth lane transitions
- Obstacle spawning system with increasing difficulty
- Collision detection (AABB)
- Scoring system with high score persistence (localStorage)
- Visual effects (animated road, car designs, coins)
- Three game states (start, playing, game over)

## What's Left to Build
- None - game is complete and functional

## Current Status
Phase: Complete
Progress: 100% complete

## Known Issues
None - game is fully functional

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Decided on single HTML file for simplicity and ease of use
- Chose lane-based movement over free movement for better gameplay control
- Progressive difficulty through speed increase to maintain engagement
